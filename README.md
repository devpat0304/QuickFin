# 💸 QuickFin

![QuickFin Logo](./ic_launcher-playstore.png)

An **interactive Android-based financial calculator app** built using **Java**, **Jetpack Compose**, and **Material Design 3 (Material You)**. This project was developed as part of **CSE 3310: Software Engineering** at **The University of Texas at Arlington** 🎓 by Group 6: *Money Masters*.

The **QuickFin** application helps users make fast, informed financial decisions by offering six real-world calculators within a single mobile interface. From tipping at a restaurant to estimating mortgage payments, QuickFin empowers users with accurate, on-demand tools that are neatly categorized, easy to navigate, and visually cohesive across devices.

Designed following **Agile methodology** in three iterative development cycles, QuickFin highlights key software engineering principles such as **modularity**, **reusability**, **scalability**, and **user-centered design**. Each calculator is implemented as its own activity and seamlessly integrated into the main menu screen using **Material navigation** principles.
